Although you can get through quickly if you take take the route from Tjåmotis into Aktse and you might make it to Akkastugorna in 5 days, I would not recommend it. You should take extra days in case of delays, and if you are not late, you can use those extra days for detours or day trips. However, if you mean you have 7 days to get from Aktse to Kisuris (for example), you should be OK. Kungsleden (the mountain \"highway\" full of cabins and trails so well maintained they remind of North American National Parks) leads through the far southeastern corner of the park, from Saltoluokta via Aktse to Kvikkjokk. At Aktse, you can take a boat to a point under Nammásj. From here, there is a reasonably good trail all the way to Skarja and Kutjaure at the tri-park-point with Stora Sjöfallet and Padjelanta. Although this trail is not an official trail and contains some laborious stretches, in particular through Rapaselet, it is nowhere difficult by Sarek standards, and at times actually has wooden planks laid out through wet areas. However, you will still need a tent and you will still need to ford streams. There are no navigational challenges. This route is popular and if you hike it in summer, you will meet plenty of other people, probably several groups every day. That makes it easier as well, because you will not need to bring equipment such as a satellite phone: in summer on the trail you are certain to meet other people who may be of assistance in case of an emergency (by warning authorities as soon as they reach civilisation). However, I recommend autumn as the birch forest may be full of mosquitoes in summer. I hiked this route in September 2013, and it\\'s very, very beautiful, in particular the view from Skierffe above Aktse. We met people three times in total. If you do one thing in Sarek, hike to Skierffe — you can do it as a day trip from Aktse. You can also hike from Skierffe down to Rapadalen (we did this in 2013) but that requires more off-trail navigation including through the woods. If you seriously only have 5–7 days, you won\\'t make it far into Sarek. Use Aktse as a base and hike into the park 1–2 days, then turn around to where you came from.

(CB) 1987 1987 A radical few are pushing for creation of \"no-rescue zones,\" where people would be on their own in the natural world--come hell or high water. \"We live in a society where people want to experience the benefits of high adventure but then force somebody else to pay the costs when things go wrong,\" said Leo McAvoy, a University of Minnesota professor who favors no-rescue zones. \"It\\'s time for some self-responsibility.\" 1993 1994 1994 1994 The lack of judgment and personal responsibility of wilderness travelers with the resultant cost of rescue has led to the proposal of no-rescue zones. Certain wilderness areas would be posted with advisories that travelers enter at their own risk; helicopters (and possibly search teams) would not enter. Given the current legal climate in the United States, this concept is unlikely to win support. 1995 Second, because of the high fee, the climbing community felt they were being singled out and attacked. They argued strongly for ideas like \"no rescue zones\" and personal bonding, and they attacked several aspects of the Service\\'s mountaineering program. Some of the arguments were simply unrealistic. History has repeatedly shown that climbers in trouble will call for help, and if they don\\'t families will call politicians who will demand that the Service respond. 1995 2005 No-rescue wilderness is an idea based on the preservation of the wilderness experiance Users are solely responsible for their own personal welfare. agencies that manage that area of land would be absolved of all legal risks involved agencies would infact be prohibited from intervening in no rescue areas for any reason! 2012 Attempting to rouse more pointed debate, Kennedy suggested, “I wonder if we shouldn’t have no-rescue zones.” That would be the extreme, libertarian response to Simonson’s “buyer beware” in a market that should only properly be selling, in Viesturs’ phrase, “a chance to try,” not the right to reach the summit. 2007 This Mount Hood story has a lot of folks demanding that reckless hikers and climbers who need rescuing be billed for the rescue, or even that certain zones be declared no-rescue zones; if you enter them, and something goes wrong, well, been nice knowing you. 2009 In addition to defraying the cost, the frequent rescues have spurred some interesting ideas from no-rescue zones to backcountry rescue insurance. While some ideas are intriguing, others border on the bizarre. A few of these ideas might even create new industries, such as body retrieval for the many cadavers littering the new no-rescue zones. 2012 Establishment of a \"No-Rescue\" Policy or “No Rescue Zones” in Wilderness.

Lots of hikers (including me) eat mostly junk food, because it\\'s the most convenient way to have your daily calories (easy to get, easy to prepare, cheap). Fire stove are a no go: it\\'s very often forbidden due to forest fires (in my case, I would say it was forbidden 70% of the trail, and really frown upon for 15 other percents). If you want to eat healthy or varied, that will be way more expensive as you will have to prepare in advance and do mail drops. Mail drops might be required for some resupplies, but I would advise to wait to be on trail to send them, so that you can put what you really need in it. Here are the one you might want to consider as those \\'towns\\' are not good to resupply (no store or store way too small): Doc Campbell\\'s, NM Pie town, NM Ghost Ranch, NM Twin Lakes, CO (there is a general store good enough if you stay on junk food) South Pass city, WY Towns and lodging I slept in town at almost every resupply: shower, laundry, resupply, eating, good bed. Some people were only passing by. If you hike with other people (I started alone but met people on trail and was never alone in town), a night in town will be between 15-20$ and 40$ (depending on the size of your group and the location - Colorado is more expensive than Idaho). I shared room with between 2 to 5 other persons while on trail; the most I had to pay was 40$. Towns are great, but there are many ways to spend money there, like restaurant. Count between 10 et 15-20$ a meal, depending on what and where you eat. McDonald\\'s are often cheap, and for 7$ you can leave with a full stomach and plenty to drink. You will want/have to take zeros days. I took 16, some took only 5, others took 25. You can share laundry with others hikers. Gear and gear replacement I used 4 pairs of shoes, 2 underpants. The new shoes were sent to me to Post Offices along the way. You can buy Darn Tough Socks: those are really good, and there is a life warranty. It\\'s quite easy to find a store while on trail and replace them for free when they have holes. I replaced them 5 times (one time I had burnt one of them in a campfire, and it was still ok to replace it!). You might have to buy additional gear alog the way: better fleece if you\\'re too cold, bear spray (not mandatory but really, really advised) while in grizzly country. I had to buy a new mattress as my air mattress was too worn out to wistand all the trip. Orientation and planification Guthook CDT is the reference for orientation and planning. 40$ the package for all 5 sections. There are plenty of alternates, some officials, other only on Ley\\'s map or invented while on the field. The official length is 3014 miles as of 2018; the actual average length is about 2700mi. It can go as low as 2500mi if you take all the shortcuts. Don\\'t plan to much in advance: plan for the first month, no more. After that your body and your needs will change greatly, so you will have to plan accordingly. Budget per month I would say, for one month: 350$ of trail food 200$ to sleep in town if you sleep there every time you resupply (5 nights at 30$ + 1 or 2 rest days) 250$ of town food (restaurants, beers) 60$ of miscellanous (mostly laundry, mailing boxes) 150$ of gear replacement (mostly shoes, but also other stuff broken or lost) So about 1000$/month on average. You can go with way less (like 5 or 600$) if you do it without any comfort (no overnight in town, no fancy food, etc.). That\\'s the average amount advised for a thru-hike. It\\'s the same than for the AT or the PCT, because even if the trail is different our needs will stay the same. It might be easier to reduce the costs on the CDT because less towns means less temptations. Reducing the costs I spent about 1000$/month (5000$ total) without concerning me about how much I was spending (I new I have enough), so my guess would be that\\'s a good \"comfort\" budget. If I had had to reduced that amount, I would have spent less time in town (less overnights, less restaurants, and less beers). Don\\'t try to go with cheap gear that you don\\'t know, it could backfire. Nevertheless, some items can be cheap and still good and lightweight: my fleece was 10$. my rainjacket was 5$ (yes). Dri Ducks from Frogg Toggs is 20$ and very good for that price. Don\\'t rush yourself to buy the best items in every category: go out, experiment, try some DIY if you can. That\\'s the best way to cut the budget for the gear before the trail, and while on trail.',\n",

              " {'context': \"The typical protractor-style compass is an optical compass. To shoot an azimuth with it you align marks on the compass and read the bearing off the dial. The other varieties have a sighting wire which is placed over the target and a separate mechanism to help reading the bearing. The primary advantage is accuracy because the bearing can be read while observing the target; the primary drawback is that they require a separate protractor to take bearings off of a map. A lensatic compass has a lens and wire which can be unfolded. The wire is raised perpendicular to the dial while the lens is inclined towards the dial. With the compass held to your eye you align a notch on the lens holder, wire, and target much like iron sights on a rifle. Then by looking through the lens you can read the bearing off the dial. Because you don't need to move the compass to see the object and dial it's much more accurate than optical types. The prismatic compass is similarly constructed, with a prism rather than a lens. It functions much the same as a viewfinder in an SLR camera. You look through a hole at the target object and the prism reflects the dial into the bottom of your field of view. This eliminates the need for careful alignment of the lensatic style; you don't even need to move an eye to glance at the lens. For hiking and camping the type is completely irrelevant because the margin of error in dead reckoning grossly exceeds the error of any sighting compass. For precision work from a fixed position such as a surveyor's tripod or fire tower a prismatic compass is the natural choice because it's a few minutes more accurate than the lensatic. The military tends towards lensatic models because they're accurate enough to direct fire, cheap, and durable. Don't overlook the durability angle if you've already decided to forgo the integrated protractor/measurement of a baseplate compass. The military ones are housed in a steel clamshell which takes beatings much better than plastic models.

W3W can target a building entrance or location that doesn't have a street address fairly accurately. However, I think you are right to be sceptical. Pros Ease of remembering certain locations. Shorter values (three words to mark a 3mx3m square, which for most applications is more than adequate), as opposed to lengthy lat and long numbers. Particularly as longer words are reserved for squares that will be used less, such as over the ocean. Makes sharing locations over, for example, poor quality phone lines more reliable (possibly). Useful where street names aren’t really used or in areas where a single postcode can cover a large area. Cons The algorithm is closed source and whilst the developers promise not to game the system (such as sponsorship deals to change the words used to identify a corporate HQ to something relevant to that company - e.g. Ford's HQ being identified by cool.motor.cars ) a promise really isn't worth anything IMO. Licensing costs for car manufacturers etc to put the technology in their products. Doesn't work with altitude, although to be fair, neither does lat and long without adding a height vector. Current systems (GPS, lat/long, zip & post codes) are so ubiquitous that I can't see this system becoming universally adopted. It is non-hierarchical.

You're going to be piling on a significant amount of loft and protection, and you don't want the whole thing collapsing on you in your sleep. I think the general recommendation here is to find a large branch or log around 10 feet long, and prop it up in the fork of a tree. You'll then prop up smaller branches or large sticks along both sides of that main branch to create a wedge-shaped frame for your structure, as seen in the first image below : Insulation & Protection: The next step is adding loft to help insulate your shelter and offer basic wind and rain protection. Basically, just grab arm-fulls of the small sticks, leaves and other debris that are all over the forest floor and pile them on your structure. It can be tricky to get them to stay on top without sliding off the side or falling between the branches, so start around the base and build your way up. Patience is a key part of this. Trash bags can be useful for this, if you have them. Depending on how cold it is and what the conditions are like, you should try to have 2-3 feet of loft covering your structure, as seen in the second image, above. You want it to be thick, but matted down so that it doesn't all blow away while you're sleeping. 2-3 feet of loft might sound like a lot, but you'll want as much as you can get to ensure you stay warm and dry.\",\n",

A less aggressive edge (0-1 degree) won\\'t bite as easily, but wears down slower and is more comfortable to ride for beginners. The base bevel and side bevel can both be changed, but typically you only sharpen from the sides once everything is set. There are two ways to apply this angle change. One is by eye, using a file. This method isn\\'t very reliable for a consistent angle, but unless you\\'re skiing really hard you probably will do just fine. You can wrap a little tape around your file to tilt it upwards a hair as a simple guide. The next method is using a fixed bevel tool or a multi-angle tool. Ski shops use the fixed ones because they are the most reliable and consistent, but they are also more expensive (for reference, see this bevel tool , which costs $20, and you only have one bevel option). These tools typically accept either a diamond stone or regular file. Don\\'t forget to de-tune the first few inches of your skis when you\\'re done!

I\\'ve only met a few people who used synthetic bags on thru-hikes, and they were all quilt users, so assuming you go for down, I would aim for these companies (in this order): Western Mountaineering or Feathered Friends, Montbell, Marmot (only 800+ fill, the rest of their bags aren\\'t so good), Mountain Hardware. There are a bunch more of course, but when you\\'re going to spend 130-150 days in a sleeping bag, it\\'s worth getting one that will still be lofty at the end of your trip, and for that you have to shell out for good down fill. If you\\'re more interested in quilts, Jacks R Better, or Nunatak if you are literally made of money. You mentioned a 5 month hike starting in March - by my calculation you would be done in August which should make weather issues moot, even in Maine. So you would likely be fine with your summer bag til then. Note I have not hiked the AT, but I have hiked the PCT and CDT, and listened to endless gear talk from my hiking partners. PS: if you are totally insane, do what this guy I met on the CDT did: used a garbage bag as his sleeping bag for the first half of the AT (he started later though - June). Sound comfortable?',\n",

              " {'context': \"I understand your goal in asking this question, but I think you're approaching it wrong: you should choose a kayak based on your skill and expected use. Each type of kayak will have benefits and drawbacks in each type of water, and some are completely unsuited for it -- choose one that fits your uses best. A well-known example: a recreational kayak is the wrong choice for kayaking on the ocean. Class 1 and 2 rapids are fantastic. I think it's probably fair to say that anybody with no skill and the right boat can make it through class 1 rapids with no concern. I think class 2 rapids should probably be handled by somebody with at least a little experience on the water, and the less experienced should always be accompanied by somebody more experienced. So, I am confident that you could do some class 1 rapids with any of those types of kayaks. For class two rapids, I would first be concerned with your skill level -- both on the water in general, and with the type of kayak being used (and maybe even the specific model). While class two rapids may not require much maneuvering, spinning a 20' sea/touring kayak is going to be practically impossible and therefore impractical; a 14-16' sea kayak is probably manageable for any experienced paddler. A whitewater or completely flat-bottomed rec kayak provide the maneuverability required, however a less experienced paddler will find themselves spinning with each stroke and out of control -- and therefore perhaps in a dangerous situation. In my opinion, the right choice for a new paddler is a rec kayak. They're fun, easy to use, and relatively cheap to buy/rent. Getting some experience with an eye towards determining what you ultimately want to do will help you make an informed decision. Rent a few times and take a lesson or two and you'll have gained a huge amount of experience to help you know what kind of kayak you really want and will lead you to the best choice. Experience is king. An experienced paddler will be able to take anything through class 1 or 2 rapids, no doubt. An inexperienced paddler could end up in a dangerous situation. I think it's essential to start out on calm flat water to learn strokes, practice technique, and gain some confidence. On that flat water you can learn to maneuver the kayak around strainers, rocks, or buoys. You can learn how a sweep differs from a front stroke, and what you can make the kayak do with each of those. Also on flat water, try working in windy conditions -- it'll do a surprisingly good job of mimicking how a river and rapids can push your boat around and teach you how to handle it. Once confident, go out on a slow river to put your skills to the test. Eventually move up to some faster moving water, and throw in a class 1 rapid. Try a short class 2 next. Then if you can find it, go through a long class 2 -- you'll get splashed quite a bit and get a solid workout. After working through class 2 you might want to step up to class 3. While gaining all of this experience you're going to learn how a kayak handles and what it does well and poorly, and more importantly you're going to see how your skill grows with it. As you do this stuff you'll be able to recognize where each type of boat is the right choice. Trying to more directly answer your question: IMO, a whitewater kayak is only useful for whitewater/surfing waves. A sit on top is good for jumping in and out of the water. A rec kayak is a good choice for many. A short touring/sea kayak is a good choice for many. A long touring/sea kayak is the right choice for racers and travelers.\",\n",

              " {'context': 'Skiing is a full-body, high endurance, activity. Being in good cardio-vascular shape is important, and can be achieved through running, swimming, rowing, etc... This can not be over-emphasized. Get your heart in shape. Assuming you already are in decent shape, here are some exercises that will help you get through those initial days on the hill. I\\'ve chosen exercises that require no additional weight -- your body and gravity provide all the resistance you need. (Some can be enhanced by holding light weights if so desired.) --Leg Strengthening-- Wall squats: Sit with your back against a wall, your feet together on the ground, and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Hold for increasing amounts of time. As strength increases, raise one leg at a time horizontal out in front of you. Repeating multiple reps of 30 seconds to a minute. Feel the burn. Lunges: Take a large step, dropping your back knee to the ground while bending your front knee (try to keep the front knee at a 90 degree angle). Return to standing, repeat for other leg forward. Do 50 steps or more. One legged speed squats: Stand with 90% weight on one leg, and 10% on the other. Squat down and stand up as rapidly as you feel comfortable for 20-40 reps. Repeat other side. Plyometrics: If you are already in good general shape, plyometrics will amp up your legs into bomber ski shape**. Simple moves like: jump-squats: lower into a squatting position, feet shoulder width apart, then explode up through standing and jump. Return to squat position. standing three-direction jumps: stand upright, feet together. Jump up, twisting your lower body so your feet now point to the right, but shoulders point forward. Jump back to center, then left. Right -Center -Left -Center -Right. Imagine the snow-flocked pine trees whipping by your face. High knee jumps (Jump knee-tucks): Stand upright. Keeping your torso at the same height, jump your knees up toward your chest repeatedly. (Legs come up, body stays the same). --Core strength-- Your core is also super-important. Skiing (done right) requires a lot of twisting (shoulders stay pointing downhill while your lower body carves back and forth.) Crunches, sit-ups, side presses , etc are all super-helpful and common exercises, so I won\\'t explain them. A new one I\\'ve added to my repetoire (thanks P90X!) is \"Mason Twists\" aka Russian Twists: Sit with your back straight and your legs elevated in front of you so your body makes a V feet at chest level. Clasp your hands. Rotate your torso, and hit the ground on the left side with both hands. Rotate your torso to hit the ground on the right side with both hands. Go back and forth, side-to-side for 40-50 reps in rapid succession. --Balance and static strength-- Skiing is a balance sport. Knowing how your body moves, how it is centered, and how your body responds is important. Consider various yoga moves: Warrior 1,2 and 3: I won\\'t try to describe them here, since they are easy to do wrong. I recommend seeking a yoga class in your area. But the warriors are GREAT for strengthening your knees (common ski injury areas) and learning balance. Tree Pose: The ultimate balance posture. In its simplest form, stand with good posture on one leg for as long as you can. A regular yoga practice will help in all areas of fitness. * *NOTE: Higher-impact exercises like plyometrics can cause injury if done improperly. Land softly when you jump.

Look for the places where you are most likely to find rabbits.

Fix a base deep in the ground. Make a notch on it to latch the trigger in it as shown. Craft a trigger which can be latched into the base as shown. This may take some time. Tie a string (you can use a shoelace) to the tip of the small plant. The plant should be tough enough to bear the weight of a rabbit. Make a loop of wire and tie it to the trigger part. Practice the loop part multiple times as this simple knot is too crucial to fail. You may have to put some obstacles around the set up so that the animal is forced to be diverted towards the setup.

So that when he necks though the loop and move ahead, the latch is popped, the trigger is lifted and the rabbit is hung. This set up may fail in case of strong winds and other physical disturbances. make sure the you don't put one such set up on a cattle trail as that would injure the cattle. Lastly, a humble request, on a personal note, though hunting is legal in many parts of the world, try not to hunt for no reason and just for fun, be humane with your hunting techniques. Don't trap an animal for fun and in a manner that it would torture them physically. God forbid, but, if you at all are really into a situation where hunting is the last resort for survival, make sure that you kill them quick, after-all its a life that you are taking, don't make it slow and painful.\",\n",

              " {'context': 'I\\'ve been up close with grizzly and black bears before, I\\'ve had them come sniffing through my camp and I\\'ve done nothing but lay quiet in my sleeping bag and wait for them to wander off, which they usually do. Most of the time I don\\'t even know they were there, I just find their tracks the next morning. Believe it or not bears spook really easily. I\\'ve never had to use bear spray or shoot at a bear, they always run off as soon as we let them know we\\'re getting close. So if you\\'re in your tent and a bear is taking his time investigating your site, all you have to do most of the time is just announce yourself and that should be enough to scare them away. The human voice is the number one deterrent for bears , so just start making loud noises. This will work most of the time, but the real problem bears are the ones that are used to humans, especially the ones that have been fed by humans in the past or found food in camps before, if one of these bears wanders into you site and doesn\\'t act like it intends to leave without first finding something to eat, then get your bear spray out, get out of the tent, act big and keep shouting. You need to be pretty close for bear spray to be effective (30ft/9m or closer) so only spray it if your other attempts don\\'t work and the bear is approaching you, or letting you approach him. Do NOT spray it inside of your tent, you will immediately regret it and possibly do yourself some serious harm. Try to get upwind of the bear if possible, and aim for his nose. One good blast and that bear should take off real quick. Most people only cary one or the other, bear spray or a gun. A warning shot from a gun does just as good as bear spray does. People around here (Canadian Rockies) that hike with shotguns load it with 3 different types of ammo; the first round is just bird shot, to shoot in the air as a warning shot; the second shot is a slug, to shoot past the bear so he can hear the ball whistling past him; the rest of your rounds are all hollow-point bear stoppers, to put the beast down, because if the first two shots don\\'t scare him away then nothing else is going to stop him. Hunters have bigger problems with bears than campers do, because hunters typically have a fresh kill with them that the bear wants (usually grizzly bears), with campers and hikers, it\\'s usually a case of the hikers sneaking up on the bear unintentionally and surprising it-in which case the bear acts defensively- or bears happening upon a campsite because it\\'s on the side of a trail (bears use trails too) and finding food there. Shotguns are only necessary if the bear charges, tries to get into your tent, or is following you and you can\\'t shake them off your trial. This is especially true with black bears, if a black bear is following you, and isn\\'t scared off by any of your attempts to get him to leave, then odds are good you\\'re going to have to either fight it off or shoot it, because there have been incidents where black bears have been known to stalk people for food. These incidents are very rare, and will typically only occur in the most wild areas where bears don\\'t have much contact with humans. ... suppose a bear finds my tent and likes the smell of warm man-flesh inside of it. Coming from bear country, if shouting at it doesn\\'t scare it away and you have a gun, ten out of ten people where I\\'m from would say shoot it . Right through the tent. Don\\'t even feel guilty about it, because if you don\\'t shoot it, then a ranger probably will as soon as you report the encounter (assuming you managed to scare it off some other way). They don\\'t tolerate bears that behave that way because they\\'re a risk to people\\'s safety. You\\'ve probably heard the saying, \"A fed bear is a dead bear.\" They say that because 99% of the time, bears that get hand outs or find human food end up getting put down because they always come back for more. If you have a bear trying to get in your tent, and you don\\'t have a gun: FIGHT IT . You are literally fighting for your life, so kick, scream, hit it in the face with anything you\\'ve got. Bear spray will only work if there\\'s nothing in between you and the bear, so try to get out of your tent before trying to spray it, or like I said already, you can actually make things worse for yourself if you spray it inside of your tent.

Unlike a Lolotte (drop knee), the less aggressive backstep typically exploits footholds below knee level.

Without those aids which you'd be hard pressed to create while marooned on an island your navigational options are limited. The best you can really hope for is to follow a latitude line/plane. I think a cross staff would be an effective celestial navigational aid that could be improvised and allow you to follow a latitude line. Normally the shorter cross piece would slide up and down the length of the staff to allow you to measure angles. That is going to be too hard to calibrate, unless you know the angles between enough stars to calibrate it yourself. If you can calibrate the cross staff then you can pick the latitude you want, sail to that plane and turn east or west to follow it. If you can't calibrate it you need to sit on your boat at night and adjust (whittle) the length of the shorter cross piece so it lines up with the North star or the Southern Cross and the horizon. Once this is accomplished then you can maintain your current latitude by repeating the sighting and correcting as needed. Another option for latitude based navigation would be a Sun Compass. Of course the Achilles heel of this device is the sun's height varies increasingly as you move away from the equator. The proper name for this pattern is an analemma. Due to this variance you need to be lucky and be close to the equator and make corrections with your cross staff as needed.

              " {'context': \"Bryce Towsley has this story to tell us about a grizzly attack: Shortly before I arrived in one northern Alaska camp, a couple of packers were rushing to beat the failing light. Covered with blood and loaded down with packs of caribou meat that doubled the weight pressing on their boots, they were tired and thinking mostly about a hot meal and a dry sleeping bag as they pressed toward camp. As the lead guy pushed through the thick brush along the river a very large grizzly bear stood up and took a swing at his head. Young reflexes saved him, as he ducked and the bear hit the pack, knocking him down. He rolled, drew the .44 Magnum pistol in his chest holster and emptied it into the bear, ending the encounter. Bryce Towsley goes on to say this about handguns and bears in his article Packing Pistols In Bear Country . The .44 Magnum is probably the bottom limit. I know, some guys claim the .41 Magnum or even the .357 Magnum is fine, but I do not agree. I have watched them both work on black bears and I was never impressed. The point here is not to prove you can stop a charging bear with a smaller, inadequate cartridge. The point is to survive. So, I think a .44 Magnum is the starting point. It is also important to use a heavy bullet. The key is to penetrate through bone and through a lot of critter, and for that you need bullet weight: at least 300 grains for a .44 Magnum and that much or more for any of the .454 Casull or heavy .45 Colt loads. I use 400-grain bullets in my .500 Wyoming Express; with some bigger cartridges like the .500 S&W Magnum you can go up as high as 500 grains. Part of the bullet-weight decision, though, should be based on your ability to shoot the cartridge. A 500-grain bullet at 1450 fps from a handgun is not a load most NPR listeners will want to shoot. I have passed my personal limits with some of the biggest cartridges when used in lightweight, carry-style handguns. For example, in my .500 Wyoming Express I had to back off from the full-power loads. A 400-grain bullet at 1600 fps proved too much for me (and everybody else who shot it) to handle well in a relatively light, 2-pound, 12-ounce Freedom Arms revolver. So I backed it down to about 1300 fps and found the load much more manageable, but still plenty bear-worthy. Cartridge selection? Well, I really believe any handgun you bring to any fight should have a name that starts with at least a 4. That’s really important if you are fighting a bear! I think the rule of “4-3-1” should apply: a bullet diameter that starts with at least a 4, a bullet weight that starts with at least a 3 and a muzzle velocity of at least 1000 fps.

              " {'context': \"A normally lethal shot with a bow hits both lungs and possibly the heart. This shot was interesting because the arrow didn't go very far in and probably only hit one lung. I haven't hunted moose, but have shot elk, and most of my shots go completely through the animal. Sometimes a bone gets in the way and if you watch the arrow in the video right after it impacts, there is still a good deal of shaft left exposed and the nock end seems to immediately get levered to the front of the moose. This is probably because the shot entered just behind the leg/shoulder structure. As the leg levered the arrow around, the broadhead that is inside the animal should cut a huge swath of tissue causing a good amount of bleeding inside the lung. The shallow hit on an animal that size probably means a bone strike and it didn't get both lungs, but the one lung that is hit was cut open internally. Lung shots do two things to the animal, the first is that the blood loss from the wound can be significant because of the amount of blood that flows through the lungs. The other effect is immobilizing the lungs and making them stop oxygenating the blood by filling the lung cavity with blood or with air that leaks out of the lung hole (called a tension pnuemothorax). The elk I have seen that have been lung shot wind-down just like this one did in the video. If you are tracking a wounded deer/elk/moose and suspect this type of wound and dying pattern, you can get tricked by the track they make because as they die, they get weaker and possibly dizzy. If you start to track them up a hill and the track suddenly dies, backtrack downhill or through the path of least resistance and you will often find your animal. You will often see pinkish tissue in the blood trail at some point where bits of the shredded lung are blown out through the mouth, and this lets you know you probably had a good lung shot. On the other hand, a heart shot will stop the blood pumping fairly quickly and there will be less blood to track, but shorter trail to follow. The first elk I ever shot I punched right through the shoulder blade and had a somewhat shallow strike. I watched the elk run off with the arrow flagging just like the one in the video here. The elk ran up a hill a few yards and just fell down stone dead. When I opened the chest cavity, the moving broadhead had severed the aorta right off the heart and made for a very quick death and no tracking required.\",\n",

I wouldn't be comfortable, but at least I'd make it out.

              " {'context': 'tl;dr Gather a few plants from your area. For each one, flip a coin; if it\\'s tails, you can use it for what you describe. Where I\\'m coming from on this I live near the area you specify; in New York, not in the Adirondacks but to the west of them, and I have been there. Fortunately though, my advice is generic. I have just recently gotten deeper into the cord/rope making craft, and I have been pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to make and how many resources will work. I have made a bunch of cords and ropes recently out of many different materials. The one part of your question that I cannot answer directly (but which I would say is not super important) is to be specific about species; I do not know what most of the plants around me are, but I just use them anyway, and most of them work! So here is my advice... The Good Part I have found that more plants seem to work than to not for this. Grasses, flowers, fibers, etc.. Anything that is soft and bendable is obviously a good first choice. Even if it is soft and breaks easily, that is usually fine if you just work in more of it. One extreme of the spectrum: mowed grass Even if it is short, that has not been a problem for me. Just a few days ago, I even decided to try it with short, mowed grass. I thought it would be difficult, maybe impossible, but I was surprised to find that even mowed grass, just 2 to 4 inches, made fine cord using the standard technique. I just started with a much smaller V to begin with the longest couple of grass blades I could find - I think those two blades were 4 or 5 inches - and I had to twist in extra material much more often than with longer resources. I made a cord that was a few millimeters thick, and it could have been used for some very lightweight purposes, and if made thicker it might have worked even for the table example you ask for. Obviously, un-mowed grass that is a few feet long will work much better than mowed grass. This was just to make a point. More plants will work if you soften them up first Many plants that are not fibrous and which seem too tough and non-pliable to use, I have found that I can still use them if I soften them up first. For some of the plants, I carefully squeeze the stem until it partially crushes, and some still hold together decent even if fully crushed. This allows them to bend some and to tie around objects, especially if the objects are large such that the plant needn\\'t form a tight bend. Another softening technique Similar to the previous technique, I have found that some plants become quite workable if I do the following, assuming they do not simply snap into two pieces when I try this but instead stays together after breaking: I bend the plant carefully until it breaks (but does not come apart; it is still 1 length), and then I either try to repeat this making many breaks along the plant, or if the plant is not too stiff sometimes I can \"slide\" the break (not sure how else to describe it) along the plant so that it is thoroughly broken along the entire length - some plants still hold together well after doing this. Then it is workable enough to use as with other methods. Sometimes a processed cord is not necessary Also, some plants seem to be strong enough to use directly, without processing into nice cord or rope. I have found multiple plants which I can directly pluck and straight away tie into a circle and have a difficult time breaking them; they would work great for the situation you describe. Sometimes these plants, though working without being cord or rope, do still require processing like in the previous two techniques I mention. The default technique Of course, there is the technique I see most advertised: try to get strands of fiber from plants, often from inside the bark of woody plants (including trees) and twist them together. A tip on determination for the frustrated Just because I make the bold claim that most of the plants around me work for tying/lashing, that does not mean that it\\'s all sugar and spice. What I do when I\\'m unsure of the resources in an area: I go for a short walk and take some time to look at all the different plants nearby, and I choose many of them that look promising and even some that do not look promising. I gather an armload of 5, or 10, or even more, different plant types - and often several plants of each type that I pick, sometimes it\\'s more than an armload - and I sit down with them all and test each one. This can take a while. Sometimes I spend an hour just experimenting with what I gathered, and I find that these 2 plants work ok, this 1 barely works, those 2 work terrible, this 1 simply cannot work at all, and this one works great. Then based on the best candidates, I decide which one I will use: which one was most abundant? easiest to pick? did it make me itch or sting when I handled it? etc. Then I go gather. Depending on how far away the resource was or how plentiful or scarce it was: I will either gather several times more than I need to be safe (I still mess up and need to redo sometimes), or I gather just what I need and either go back for more if needed or sit and work at the resource\\'s location. The cliché phrase is very true here: if at first you don\\'t succeed, try and try again. Do not be afraid to fail a lot. Just this morning I tried several new (to me) resources for making baskets, and I insisted on limiting myself to the materials a family member had on their 1-acre property, even when they suggested some proper basket-weaving plants \"just over their, off the property\". I tried several times, and I did not complete any of the baskets I started; one of the materials was sort of working and maybe I could have finished a basket with a lot of very slow, careful, hard work, but I decided it was not worth it and moved on to some different materials. This morning\\'s basket making attempts were very enlightening for me, but I would consider the basket making itself to have been a failure - even if I did finish the one that was sort-of working it would have been a weak and flimsy basket. Another fun extreme: More grass What inspired me to get back into this skill and develop it more was reading a website about making ropes from grass. You can find the site that re-inspired me here. On that web page, a technique is discussed which uses multiple people and large bundles of grass to make large, strong ropes. The technique is based on the typical \"take a bit of your material, make a V, keep twisting in material into each side\" cordage technique, except it is scaled way up to a point where each person is doing what one or two of your fingers are doing when making the cordage by yourself. The ropes that guy makes, with groups of people, are said to be thick but strong, generally taking loads of hundreds of pounds. He claims that one rope they made could not be broken in a game of tug-of-war between a large group of adults. And this is grass . I am tempted now to include an entire section about some cultures which have (and still do in some cases) do neat things with grass ropes, such as the amazing bridges made out of grass ropes. But instead of delving into that, I will just mention it and suggest that Googling something like \"ancient grass bridges\" would provide interesting reading material. I would not want to trust a high bridge made of grass, but if done by skilled workers they do a fine job. Conclusion I used to have a hard time with this and considered paracord an integral part of my outdoor activities. But after experimenting with all of the plants I can find and practicing with them, I have found that it is actually difficult for me to go somewhere now and not find something that can be used for tying/lashing. Wherever I go, there seems to be multiple plants that fulfill the need. Even in the city, as long as it is a city with lawns, even fresh-mowed lawns provide adequate cord if you are determined enough - and I have done it from a city lot. Summary So, in essence, my answer is: The materials that work for your needs depends on your experience with them. Instead of researching which sources make the best cords or ropes, it is probably a better use of your time to learn how to make them from a larger range of sources. If you have practiced this, gather from 5 different plants (including trees) from the location you are in, and I would be surprised if you cannot find a suitable material for what you describe among what you have gathered. I cannot identify most of the stuff I use; I just use it and it just works. Disclaimer Of course, I have not traveled extensively far away. Perhaps my thoughts about this would be dashed if I left the U.S. north-east and went camping in the mid-west or in a different country. But thinking back to videos I have seen of situations in other countries, I am fairly confident of my previous statements. Of course, an area that does not have multiple or abundant plants, like a desert, is another story entirely, but I think my answer should work for most of the world, and it is catered to New York state as you requested. Also note: some of the materials may degrade quickly. I have never tested any of mine after a long time, but I have seen others say that their crude ropes (untreated, hastily constructed with poor weave or twist technique) has only lasted for months, or even days for some poor quality materials. I feel it important to add this so that you do not get the idea that all plants that work initially can be trusted to hold your large potting plant of garlic through the winter while you are away; when you come back in the spring that pot might be dumped on the ground. When I originally wrote this answer, I was envisioning something like \"I\\'m roughing it for a week or two and I want my own crudely built stuff while I\\'m here so it can be \\'luxurious roughing it\\'.\"',\n",

              " {'context': \"BSO stands for Bicycle Shaped Object. Or department store bike. Bicycle people are not down on them for being cheap. They are down on them for low value. Even at $100 it is not a good value. Characteristics of a BSO is not just cheap parts but non standard parts. When they do break (which won't be long) it will be hard to replace the part. Some times they do not even honor standards. It might have a non-standard bottom bracket or head set. Also safety. BSO is just not as strong. If it fails you can get hurt. You have lot more leverage on a folding with long seat tube and handle bars to the frame. It takes more stress than a full size bike. Start with a bike that has standard parts and standard sizing of components. It can be the cheapest Shimano, SRAM ... groups. If components are not stamped with a known manufacturer then no. In bikes there a value point where the cost of ownership optimized. As you spend more initially the cost of maintenance goes down. Then you get to a point the components are for weight / speed and more expensive parts and the cost of maintenance goes up. In a regular bike where is that max value is debatable but some where around $600 - $800 retail. For me max value is to find a bike that was $1200 new and pick it up used for $400. I don't know as much about folding but that sweet spot will likely be more. Folding same thing look for standard components. Without a triangle folding bikes have more flex. Then on top of that hinged parts have flex. Internal gear hubs are more common for clearance. How compact is a factor. The more it folds the more opportunities for weak points. Speed of folding. With some assemble required it is typically a stronger set up for the same price range. Some fold side to side and some fold front to back. Fold back has less side to side flex but it is also more in the more expensive. Get on the bike and see how it fits. Flex it and look for play. If you can notice play in any of the hinges just flexing with your hand then no. Bromptom is one of major manufacturers and they start at $1200. I am sure there are some good value bikes less than that - just a data point. That said if you want a folding BSO go to Wallmart for $200 and see how long it lasts. On storage hang from the ceiling frees up floor space Another option is S & S couple. It is an add on the full frame lets the triangle be disassemble. If has all the pluses of a full size bike and the coupling is nearly as strong with no flex. They assemble in like 30 minutes and tools are required. You also need to be able to tune the bike as take apart and put it back together can mess with the tuning. This is more for a person that wants to put a bike on a plane. They are higher end expensive bikes. Not what you are looking for but I thought it was worth mentioning. vaya travel Another option is a single speed mountain bike. Preferable with a rigid ford. Shocks are really bad on inexpensive bikes and wear out quickly. Because of the sloping top tube it is more narrow. Pull the seat tube, tires, and handle bar and spin the fork 180 so the camber is towards the frame. Single speed as easier disassembly and less cables. Can just loosen the handle bars and spin them or go all the way and remove the fork. A full size single speed mtn is going to out perform even a high end folding bike. More comfortable and reliable. That is high end bike I picked up $900. It was not stolen - he had the original paper work.\",\n",

If you live in a small urban apartment or lack access to a vehicle with a roof rack and don’t have a good storage by point of use option you probably have no possibility of a rigid board.

This is somewhat offset by not needing to take time to secure an object which would do incalculable damage if it came loose on a freeway. Inflatable SUP’s are incredibly resistant to damage during handling (windy parking lots, submerged stones, rocky shores). Fiberglass SUP’s need to be treated with more care. Patching pinhole leaks require much less skill than repairing fiberglass. The actual paddling performance of a rigid is categorically better, like an adult’s bicycle compared to a child’s. I owned a fairly high performance (for 2013) inflatable for the explicit purpose of surfing and while yes I could go catch waves and yes it was enormously better than not surfing and yes I’d rather be hit in the head with an inflatable, it was a bit like doing telemark turns in leather boots, fun for the fact that you’re out there and the challenge of doing it at all. The lack of stiffness (not just the rail—-the whole thing would fold up a bit on a steep wave) was significant.

Some concerns about either placement are: Leg Loops If you\\'re placing an autoblock on your leg loop AND you\\'re using a \"quick release\" buckle, the carabiner that\\'s holding the autoblock can catch on the buckle and release the tension on that leg loop. It probably wouldn\\'t make you fall out of your harness, but would be uncomfortable, and you\\'d hang at an odd angle. The leg loops of a harness aren\\'t strength-tested independently of the harness as a unit. Also, if the autoblock did manage to catch the entire weight of the climber, it would place a different stress on the leg loop than a person normally weighting the harness would. If you had a harness with stitched leg loops, like the Black Diamond Chaos, the weight of the autoblock would be pulling the stitches apart (this is not the direction of force you have when you weight a harness normally). I no longer put my autoblock on my leg loop for the reasons I mention above. I originally did, when I had a different harness, but my 2 current harnesses are the new Misty Mountain Cadallac, and the Black Diamond Chaos, one has quick release buckes, and the other has stiched leg loops. Belay Loop If you\\'re placing an autoblock on your belay loop, you have to make sure and extend your belay device when rappeling (using a sling or something like the Metolius PAS). This issue is that if the loops of the autoblock are too close to the belay device, they can get caught in it, and jam the rappel system (probably making you unable to decend the rope, but possibly forcing the rope to \"fail open\"). If you got stuck in this fashion, it would be pretty difficult to free yourself, esp. if you were in a free-hanging rappel. Sorry for not giving a single recommendation, as in many situations in climbing, there are multiple options, and its important to know what the tradeoffs are. Carabiner As per usual, you want to make sure your carabiner is loaded along its spine. That is, longways. So, one end of the carabiner will be running through the leg loop or belay loop, and the other end will have both strands of the autoblock coord. What I do I place my autoblock on my main belay loop, then extend my belay device with a PAS. The rope runs down between my legs, and I can use either hand to control my descent.

This would include products like the very common BD Raven or Raven Pro, and also those with a slight bend such as the Petzl Summit, Grivel Air Tech Evo, and BD Venom. As there are existing questions regarding length ( How do I know what size ice axe I should get? ), I'll be brief and only repeat the traditional advice of holding it by the head with your arm hanging down and picking a length where the spike reaches your ankle. (E.g. I'm 185cm tall and use a 70cm axe. I would probably be happy with a 65cm length as well. Others may advise shorter lengths; this becomes more applicable as the slopes become steeper or you don't expect to use the axe for much of the route.) These days nearly all mountaineering axes have very similar features: a positively-curved steel head and adze, a steel spike, and a straight or slightly curved shaft. A few products deviate from this: Grivel's Futura replaced the adze with a plastic handle and Petzl's Sum'tec has a pick with negative curvature. Ultralight models may use aluminum for the head and eliminate the spike, but these are not suited for sustained use or harder snow and ice. A negative curvature pick may be useful on technical routes, but is not so good for self-arrest. A straight pick is somewhat old-fashioned and not commonly seen. Note that features on the shaft (finger rests, rubber handles, etc.) may make it more difficult to plunge the shaft. With modern crampons the adze is less used for chopping steps, although it's still quite useful if you need to carve out a platform or snow bollard. It's not until you get into dedicated ice tools that you run into significant differences: interchangeable picks, being able to select between a hammer, adze, or neither, significantly curved shafts, and very ergonomic handles. I personally don't use a leash, although some people do. Regardless of your choice, there are two very important rules to keep in mind. The first is Do Not Fall, and the second is Don't Let Go Of The Axe.

Dropping snow in liquid water will help melt it faster than trying to melt a bottle of dry snow. Putting snow in your mouth is fine as long as you're warm, I do it all the time, but you are right that putting snow in your mouth will cool you down, so don't do it if you're already cold. If you are borderline hypothermic, then it would be unwise to try and expend additional body heat in order to melt snow, you need to get up, get moving, and get warm before you can even try it. This will be more difficult when you are dehydrated, as hydration has a huge role in hypothermia. One other option for melting snow is using solar radiation.

Alcohol Per Wikipedia , 8.5 vol% of ethanol make the freezing point drop to -3C (26.6F) (more values at at Wikipedia, also a diagram is available below). Most of the ethanol will be evaporized during cooking, so it's not that much an issue; also 14 vol% is only 6.8 wt%, so the added weight is 6.8%, which sounds like a lot, but still it's 1/15 only. The good thing is that you can get cheap and quite strong alcohol almost anywhere around the world. Of course, this has some issues, such as where to get spare alcohol for a longer journey; also, some alcohol will be always left in the solution, no matter how hard you try, which is not good at winter. Note that you can get a 90% alcohol at special shops, but it can get quite expensive because of the excise tax. Don't buy technical alcohol, it's denaturated, i.e. very disguisting and possibly not really safe to drink . Salts Note that you can't really do much with salts. The most efficient salt is NaF ( sodium fluoride ). However, it is poisonous, lethal dose is around 8g/100kg weight. We can compute that even a huge amount such as 34 grams of NaF in 1 litre of water reduce the freezing point to -3C. However, that's 3.4 wt%, which is freakingly lot. For NaCl ( kitchen salt ), the amount to get to -3C is 47 grams, so almost 5%. Since the relationship is linear, any reasonable amount of salt has close to zero effect on the freezing point.

They typically want to hide, unless you aren't really entering their hide-outs. For snakes that you find in Western Ghats, they typically have their habitat in thickets and holes. Very rarely you'll come across a snake in a grassland, typically when its their basking time, and I haven't seen a snake basking in such tall grass, because it doesn't make sense. The only possibility that you come across snake if it is passing through, but eventually like most of the times it will know that something (you) are coming closer. An argument can be made that if it is so, why people in India usually get bitten by a snake or come across one while they are in a sugarcane farm or a rice farming? And, the only possible valid reason I can think of is presence of rats and other preys that snakes happily feast on. The other animals you need to be aware of are hyenas and wolves. I have heard of and met people who have excelled at walking without making any noise. When I tried the same over a period of time and finally succeeded at it, I came across a Bison, not exactly in that taller grass, but in a similar region. So, be loud if you want to make sure you keep them away if they are around at all. Apart from snakes there are other things you want to be aware of while walking in tall grass. The most important of them is direction. In that case I usually refer a hill or a distant mountain as a landmark before getting into such tall grass. Additionally you can refer your GPS application periodically to check if you are heading into the direction you are supposed to, if you are equipped with it. This might be specific to the region we trek/hike around: Taller grass in Western Ghat (Well, most part of it) is seasonal. I consider season before I plan any such routes, but obviously if find yourself in a situation that you have to pass through one such long region, bang your feet (not such that it starts hurting your knees) as you walk and make sure you are with: A proper trekking attire: A full pant, a shirt with full sleeves, preferably a hat or a cap. Shoes! A walking stick which you can use to push aside the grass on the route. Do not slaughter the grass through the way, you can bend it enough to let yourself and your team pass. I am somewhat against that Machete thing. Using a stick effectively would help you judge what you are stepping into.
